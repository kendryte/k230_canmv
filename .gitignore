# This .gitignore file is intended to be minimal.

# If you find that you need additional rules, such as IDE temporary
# files, please do so either via a global .gitignore file (registered
# with core.excludesFile), or by adding private repository-specific
# rules to .git/info/exclude.  See https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
